#### Target Player Exerience

Players should have fun conquering their enemies as well as collecting more outfits for the main character. They should feel an urgency to defeat the reptoids before they take over their character's world.

#### Core Diagram

1.  Core Mechaninc

    -   The main character will have the ability to change outfits that will grant her different abilities such as greater mobility, strength, or other skills.
    

2.  Secondary Mechancis

    -   "Sugar Rush" power-up where the main character's body uses sugar to create extra energy and, therefore, becomes stronger and faster.


3.  Progression

    -   The player unlocks more costumes and abilities as they defeat more enemies and bosses.

4.  Narrative

    -   It's the night of October 31st: Halloween. As with each year, the barrier between worlds is thinning. This time, the Reptoids from the netherworld plan to invade our world, and there is only one magical girl, Hai Nyoon, who can stop them.

#### Minimal Viable Interaction

The player should move, jump and attack. There should be pits/obstacles to maneuver around, and enemies to fight.
